# VO2 Max Mask 
Super cool project to build your own VO2 Max mask.  Your "VO2 Max" is a measure of how much oxygen your body and absorb and use during exercise, read more about it [here](https://www.healthline.com/health/vo2-max#benefits).

Original idea and detailed build instructions can be found on [Instructable](https://www.instructables.com/Accurate-VO2-Max-for-Zwift-and-Strava/). 

I found the original build instructions comprehensive but fairly dense and disjointed, especially regarding the upgrades by urissel and ivor.

This is a work in progress to clean it up and make it it a little easier to follow.

This fork of [Ivor's excellent Github work](https://github.com/ihewitt/VO2max) incorporates the CO2 enhancements from Ulrich Rissel.  The intent with this repo is to make it even cleaner and easier for someone to follow clear instructions that walk them through everything from purchasing parts to building the device.  Good luck, and enjoy!

Currently (July 8th 2023) a work in progress.

## Print 3D Parts
Print out the 3D parts using PLA.  I used ASA because that's what I had and I was eager to get started. I've printed both the 20mm and the 16mm Venturi tubes.  I found the 20mm had a problem with the threads being super thin and breaking off.  For now (July 9th, 2023) I recommend against the 20mm.

*Do not* use supports on anything except the "computer housing".

<br>Test fit all parts and make sure you know where everything goes; that will make the next steps much easier.

## Wire It Up

## Assembly
I painted my button housings black for contrast.  Use superglue to secure the button housing to the case, make sure the button is inside first.

3D printing files are within the `design` folder, Ulrich Rissel's design files to use a larger venturi diameter with CO2 sensor holder in `design/CO2_upgrade`

## Usage - Zwift & Strava
* Enable bluetooth on your phone
* Go to "Record" function at bottom of screen on unit, and press it
* Look for the Heart icon at the bottom, and push that to bring up the bluetooth pairing screen to find the unit

## Usage - App
* Turn on device
* Add your weight (kg or lbs?)
* Push the Go button
* Turn on the Sensirion App, which will automatically pair and start recording data

Programing is done through the USB-C connector. 
Charging the battery is accomplished by turning on the unit and then plugging it in.

The App is designed for collecting data from a CO2 sensor so you have to spoof it by sending the Volume Minute of O2 to the CO2 level screen, the VO2 max to the Temp screen and the O2 level to the Humidity screen. 


## Additional changes in this version:
- Menu system enhanced with adjustable calibration and setup options.
- Additional GoldenCheetah integration (with VO2 master output)
- CO2 sensor support (Ulrich's mods)

## Running the unit with Zwift or Strava
Use FinalZwiftConnect with files
* DFRobot_OxygenSensor.cpp
* DFRobot_OxygenSensor.h

## Running the unit on the [Sensirion MyAmbience app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sensirion-myambience/id1529131572) (iOS)
* FinalSensirionScreen
* DFRobot_OxygenSensor.cpp
* DFRobot_OxygenSensor.h
* Sensirion_GadgetBle_Lib.cpp
* Sensirion_GadgetBle_Lib.h
